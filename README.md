# Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹
- As a web developer and designer, I made the decision to create a portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and expertise to potential clients and employers. The main purpose of the website is to demonstrate my capabilities, strengthen my credibility and attract new opportunities for full-time or freelance work.
- Building my portfolio website has been an enriching journey that has combined user research methodologies with web development skills.
