          <h2>Creating a Portfolio Website to Showcase Projects</h2>
          <p>
            As a Web Designer, I made the decision to create a portfolio website to showcase my projects,
            skills, and expertise to potential clients and employers. The main purpose of the website is to demonstrate
            my capabilities, strengthen my credibility and attract new opportunities for full-time or freelance work.
            This case study describes the process of building my portfolio website, highlighting the integration of user
            research methodologies and web development techniques.</p>

          <h3>User Research Phase</h3>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>
              <br>
              <h4>Goal Definition</h4>
              <p>I started by defining the goals of the user research. The main objectives were to understand what
                potential visitors expect from a portfolio website, identify their preferences regarding content
                presentation and navigation, and gather feedback on potential pain points to improve the user
                experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Identifying the Target Audience</h4>
              <p>In the next step, I defined my target audience, which consisted of potential employers, clients, and
                fellow Web Designers. Understanding their preferences, needs, and pain points was crucial
                in shaping the design and content of the website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Analyzing Competitor Portfolios</h4>
              <p>Analyzing portfolios of other Web Designers, especially those in my niche, provided
                valuable insights into current design trends, usability patterns, and best practices. I noted aspects
                that worked well and those that could be improved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Key Findings</h4>
              <p>The user research yielded valuable insights:
              <ul>
                <li> Most respondents preferred a clean and minimalistic design that focused on showcasing the projects.
                </li>
                <li> Clarity in project descriptions and case studies was crucial to understand the design process and
                  challenges. </li>
                <li> Visitors expected easy navigation and quick access to contact information. </li>
                <li> The ability to view the website on mobile devices was essential for a positive user experience.
                </li>
              </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Design and Development Phase</h3>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>
              <br>
              <h4>Information Architecture and Wireframes</h4>
              <p>Based on the user research findings, I created an information architecture for the website, outlining
                the main sections and content hierarchy. With the insights from interviews and competitor analysis, I
                then designed wireframes that focused on intuitive navigation, clear call-to-actions, and a visually
                cohesive layout.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Mock-ups and Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>Before diving into full-scale development, I started the web development process by creating wireframes
                and mockups. I opted for a clean and modern design with a focus on presenting the projects effectively.
                Mobile responsiveness was a priority, ensuring the website would adapt to various screen sizes. I
                conducted usability testing with a small group of potential users to identify any usability issues,
                navigational challenges, or content gaps.</p>

                alt="img">
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Visual Design and Branding</h4>
              <p>The next step was to establish a visual design that aligned with my personal brand. I chose a color
                scheme, typography, and imagery that resonated with my target audience and complemented the aesthetics
                of my projects. Consistency across the website was essential to establish a cohesive identity.</p>
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li> Color palate: #0d4591, #F2F3F4: I went ahead with blue as one of my primary colors because blue
                  stands for confidence, honesty, reliability and safety. As a passive, giving color, blue is often
                  utilized in color combinations to create the design.</li>
                <li> Logo: Created using Adobe Express Logo Maker with my initials and relevant icons.</li>
                <li> Font family: Poppins, Google fonts, designed by Indian Type Foundry, Jonny Pinhorn.
              </ul>
              </p>

                alt="img">
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Technology Stack</h4>
              <p>For the web development, I selected a technology stack that included:
              <ul>
                <li> Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a responsive framework like Bootstrap to ensure mobile
                  compatibility. </li>
                <li> I used "Netlify" a online hosting platform to host and manage the website.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Web Development and Responsive Design</h4>
              <p>Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a Bootstrap framework, I began developing the actual
                website. Adopting responsive web design principles ensured that the site would be accessible and
                visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Implementation Phase</h3>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>
              <br>
              <h4>Home Page</h4>
              <p>The home page was designed to make a strong first impression, with a brief introduction, a project
                showcase, and a navigation menu with clearly labeled sections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Implementing Portfolio Projects</h4>
              <p>To showcase my projects effectively, I created individual project pages. Each page included a project
                overview, detailed descriptions, images, and relevant links. I ensured that the projects were organized
                in a way that made it easy for users to explore and learn about my work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Bio Page and Contact Info</h4>
              <p>The "bio" page featured my bio, professional experience and relevant information. Every page included
                links to my social media profiles for easy communication.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Testing Phase</h3>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>
              <br>
              <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>I conducted usability testing with a small group of individuals, including potential clients and
                colleagues, to identify any usability issues and gather feedback for improvements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Cross-Browser & Device Testing</h4>
              <p>The website was tested across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (iOS,
                Android) to ensure compatibility and consistent performance.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Launch and Post-Launch Phase</h3>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>
              <br>
              <h4>Pre-Launch Testing</h4>
              <p>Before the official launch, I conducted thorough testing on multiple devices and browsers to ensure
                compatibility and resolve any last-minute issues. However, I recognize that the portfolio website is a
                dynamic entity and committed to continuously improving it based on user feedback and evolving project
                additions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Launch</h4>
              <p>Once everything was ready, I officially launched my portfolio website. I deployed my website on Netlify
                and updated my GitHub repository.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>
              <p>Building my portfolio website has been an enriching journey that has combined user research
                methodologies with web development skills. Having a clear understanding of my target audience's
                preferences and needs, I created a visually engaging and user-friendly website that effectively
                showcased my projects. The iterative nature of the process allowed me to continuously improve the site
                based on feedback, making it an effective tool for attracting potential clients and employers to my
                field.</p>
              <p>Overall, this case study demonstrates how a combination of user research methodologies and web
                development techniques can lead to the creation of an effective portfolio website that meets user
                expectations and achieves its intended goals.</p>
